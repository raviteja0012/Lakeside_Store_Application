// One status card per request, updated in place from asked to live.
//
// The alternative was a new message at each stage, which turns one request into six
// notifications and buries the actual answer. A card that edits itself means the thread under
// somebody's request always shows the current state in one place, and the channel stays
// readable.
//
// HOW IT FINDS ITS OWN CARD, with nothing stored anywhere. The request's Slack timestamp IS
// the thread id, and the autopilot puts that timestamp in the branch name
// (claude/slack-<ts>), so every later workflow can recover the thread from the branch alone.
// Inside the thread the card is found by asking conversations.replies and picking the bot's
// own message carrying MARKER. No database, no artifact passed between workflows, nothing to
// get out of step.
//
// STANDARDS THIS FOLLOWS, each because Slack punishes the alternative:
//   - `text` is always sent alongside `blocks`. Slack uses it for the notification and for
//     screen readers, and a card with no fallback text arrives as an empty ping.
//   - Updating sends blocks every time. chat.update with text alone DELETES the blocks, so a
//     lazy update would silently flatten the card.
//   - A failed update falls back to posting. edit_window_closed and message_not_found are
//     real and recoverable, and losing the update is worse than a second message.
//   - 429 is honoured with its Retry-After. Slack allows one message per second per channel.
//   - Nothing here ever fails the run. The build either happened or it did not; a Slack
//     outage must not turn finished work into a red run somebody re-runs.
