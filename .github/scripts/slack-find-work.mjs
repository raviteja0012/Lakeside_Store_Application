// Finds the next request to build, in a Slack channel.
//
// This is the intake loop the Jira autopilot used to be, moved to where the work is actually
// asked for. Somebody types what they want in the requests channel; this picks the oldest one
// nobody has started yet and hands it to a build.
//
// STATE IS A REACTION, not a database and not a marker buried in text. The bot adds :eyes:
// when it picks a message up, :white_check_mark: when it finishes, and :warning: when it
// stops and needs a person. The state of every request is therefore visible to anyone
// scrolling the channel, it survives this script being rewritten, and it costs no storage.
// A message carrying ANY of those three is spoken for and is skipped, which is what stops
// the loop working the same request forever. See CLAIMED below: all three, not two.
//
// WHAT IS WORK: a message that NAMES THE BOT. The channel this watches is the store's
// ordinary channel, where people say hello and talk about the weekend, so an unaddressed
// message is not a request. Without that rule "Hello Robinson Tech Team" becomes a pull
// request. Naming the bot is the Slack-native way to address something and cannot be typed
// by accident. A channel that exists only for requests can set SLACK_REQUIRE_MENTION=false.
//
// WHAT IS NOT WORK: anything the bot itself said, anything from another app, and thread
// replies. Replies are skipped on purpose for now: a thread under a finished request is
// usually people talking about it, and treating every comment as a new build is how an
// intake loop turns a conversation into ten pull requests.
//
// Silent and empty-handed when SLACK_BOT_TOKEN or SLACK_REQUEST_CHANNEL is unset, so the
// workflow is safe to merge before either exists.
