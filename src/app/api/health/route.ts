// It never returns a dollar figure. Without CRON_SECRET it answers pass/fail per check plus
// the one sentence saying what to do about a failure; with the secret it adds the database
// error and the counts, so the response is safe to call from anywhere.

// `fix` is the one sentence a person can act on. It is the only detail this route gives
