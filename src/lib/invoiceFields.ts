// Which invoice questions each department is asked, defined once.
//
// This is the vendor field registry's pattern applied to the invoice forms, proposed by
// Ravi Maddipati on 2026-08-13: "allowing fields such as vendor, payment, and purchase
// order fields to be selected by department ... would eliminate the need to develop each
// department's payment screen individually."
//
// He is right, and the proof was already in this codebase before anything here was written.
// The invoice forms have varied by department for weeks, through three hand-coded booleans
// (isPropertyDept, isFinanceDept, isHardwareDept) sprinkled across nineteen call sites in
// one thousand-line file. Hand-maintained conditionals drift: by the time this file was
// written, the EDIT form nulled a saved PO number on any invoice whose vendor was not
// Hardware, and nulled a saved service category on any invoice whose vendor was not
// Property Maintenance, while preserving the estimate number beside them. Fixing an amount
// could silently erase a filing detail. That inconsistency is the argument for a registry,
// made by the code itself.
//
// ONE CORRECTION TO THE PROPOSAL, recorded so the scope is honest: what varies by
// department is the INVOICE (and someday the purchase order), never the payment. Recording
// a payment is the engine's shape, identical for every department by design, because
// record_payment/void_payment/edit_payment are one atomic contract. This registry
// deliberately has no reach into the payment forms, and must never grow one.
//
// WHY THE SCOPE RULES DIFFER FROM vendorFields.ts. The vendor registry fails OPEN: an
// unknown department is asked everything, because losing a question means a fact cannot be
// recorded. Here the acceptance criterion is different: these are live money screens nobody
// asked to change, so the registry reproduces the old booleans' behaviour exactly for every
// department name that matches at most ONE pattern, which is all fourteen departments the
// store has ever seeded and every spelling in the owner's workbooks. The old behaviour for
// an unknown department was: delivery yes, freight yes, PO no, property work no. This file
// has two scope kinds:
//
//   { except: [...] }  everyone but these. Unknown departments are included, as the old
//                      "not finance" tests included them.
//   { only: [...] }    strictly these. Unknown departments are excluded, as the old
//                      /hardware/i test excluded them.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE, found by the review that checked this file against the old
// truth table: a department name matching TWO patterns, "Property Taxes" or "Lakeside
// Hardware", resolves here to ONE department (the first match in the owner's ORDER), where
// the old independent booleans would have applied two departments' shapes to the same
// invoice at once, hiding delivery as finance while adding the contractor block as
// property. No real department has ever had such a name, and the vendor questions already
// resolve names this way, so a combined name now gets ONE coherent shape and the SAME
// department on both its vendor form and its invoice form, instead of a blend no one
// designed. The multi-pattern cases are pinned in scripts/invoicefields-check as chosen
// behaviour, not an accident.
//
// A wrong guess is still recoverable, for the same reason as the vendor registry's rule 1:
// the invoice DISPLAY never consults this file. A saved answer shows whatever the map says,
// and the edit form writes hidden answers back rather than nulling them, so no map edit can
// destroy or strand data. Changing this map changes which questions get asked, nothing else.
