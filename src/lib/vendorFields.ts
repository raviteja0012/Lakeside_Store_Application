// What a vendor IS, defined once, per department.
//
// Before this file, every screen decided for itself which vendor columns to load and which
// to draw. Eight places queried the vendor table and no two asked for the same set, so
// Ask-the-store told the owner a summer order timeline was "not on file" when it was, and
// the add-vendor form asked a bakery about gift shows.
//
// The owner's point, recorded verbatim in docs/OWNER_NOTES.md line 367 on 2026-07-27:
//
//     "fields differ BY DEPARTMENT, the owner's core point"
//
// His own workbook has never used one shape. Bakery, Meat and Store Supplies run what that
// note calls "the light form"; Grocery carries the full merchandise shape; Hardware is
// Grocery plus a PO number; Maintenance Payments keeps who the contractor is and what they
// specialize in.
//
// HOW TO CHANGE THE MAP. The `departments` line on each field below is DATA, not structure.
// If the owner says Hardware should be asked for a summer order timeline, that is one edit
// to one array and nothing else moves.
//
// The map was seeded from his workbook census as a guess, and on 2026-08-13 he marked up the
// table in docs/owner-notes/vendor-fields-requirement.html and confirmed every line of it,
// including the two I flagged as least certain. It is now his answer, not my guess.
//
// TWO RULES THAT MAKE A WRONG GUESS SAFE:
//   1. Hiding a question never hides an answer. `visibleFacts` returns anything with a value
//      whatever the department map says, so a bakery vendor that already has a summer order
//      timeline still shows it. Data never becomes unreachable because of a guess here.
//   2. A department this file does not recognise gets EVERYTHING. Anything new somebody adds
//      is a real part of the store and must not lose fields for not being on a list.
//      (Chip Stand and Checkouts USED to be the example here. On 2026-08-13 the owner said
//      they follow Grocery and Others, so departments.ts now recognises them and they are no
//      longer the unrecognised case.)
